## Algorithms

My last experience with math and CS are beginning college courses I took over 13 years ago.

## What I hope to gain from learning CS...
* Gain a general understanding of CS
  * Be able to approach challenge questions with more optimism then I currently do. 
* Incorporate what I have learned into my website and future projects
  * Gain enough knowledge to find employment that allows me to use what I have learned thorugh VWC
* Knowledge of the language used in programing
  * I would like to be able to ask questions and understand the answers.
